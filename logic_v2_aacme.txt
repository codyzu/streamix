If you use three different files to log differnt things, then lable there purposes.

For each run add to that one file - append 10 lines seperation or some kind of breaker for each run.

It might be easier to use one file that has unlimited size.  This needs to be historical and I will manually dump the file if it gets to big.

For each run then you would use a break link and datetime stamp

****************************************

Start of run:  datetime
